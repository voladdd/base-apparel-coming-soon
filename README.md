## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

From this cata ive learned: Hot to do js form validation, how to combine css grid & flex in the simples phorm, and that its more easy to make mobile first design and only after that you can extend the complexity of the project.

```css
.some-style {
  display: grid;
}
```

### Continued development

In future projecs ill focusing on learning and accepting more difficult css grid tricks, and using SASS as it is a better & convinient option for making html templates.
